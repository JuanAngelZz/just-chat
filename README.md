## About

Welcome to **Just Chat**! 🚀 Just Chat is a unique chat application that doesn't require user registration to get started. Every user who visits the page is assigned a temporary user with a 14-day expiration period. Each user receives a unique identifier code within the chat. To chat with another user, you need to share your code via external means like Gmail or WhatsApp. If the user is found, a connection is established, and you can start chatting!
